rules:
  - title: Avoid useEffect
    tags: [react, hooks, best-practices]
    description: >
      Don't use useEffect unless absolutely necessary (e.g., for certain
      data-fetching cases). Prefer alternatives like Tanstack Query. useEffect
      is often a source of bugs and should be used sparingly.

  - title: Minimize comments
    tags: [code-style, best-practices]
    description: >
      Don't write unnecessary comments. Add comments only when explaining
      complex logic that can't be made clearer through naming or refactoring.

  - title: Tests required
    tags: [testing, quality, best-practices]
    command: npm test
    description: >
      ALWAYS create or update tests for EVERY code change. Use React Testing
      Library and Jest. Run tests and ensure they pass before marking a task
      complete.

  - title: No npm run dev
    tags: [commands, debugging]
    description: >
      Never suggest running the app (e.g., via npm run dev); assume the user
      already has the app running.

  - title: App in brazilian portuguese code in english
    tags: [best-practices, quality]
    description: >
      Write all code in English, but all UI strings should be in Brazilian
      Portuguese. Ensure every text string is supplied via proper i18n, not
      hard-coded.
