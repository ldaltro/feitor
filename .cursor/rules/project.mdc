title: Avoid useEffect
tags: [react, hooks, best-practices]
Don't use useEffect unless absolutely necessary (like for specific data fetching cases). Consider alternatives like Tanstack Query for data fetching operations. useEffect is often a source of bugs and should be used sparingly.


title: Minimize comments
tags: [code-style, best-practices]
Don't write unnecessary comments in code. Only add comments when explaining complex logic that can't be made clearer through better naming or refactoring.


title: Tests required
tags: [testing, quality, best-practices]
command: npm test
ALWAYS create or update tests for EVERY code change. Use React Testing Library and Jest for tests. Always run tests and ensure they pass before marking a task complete.

title: No npm run dev
tags: [commands, debugging]
Never suggest running the app(like suggesting a npm run dev), always assume that the user has the app running already.


title: App in brazilian portuguese code in english
tags: [best practices, quality]
Write all the code in english but the strings of the app should be in brazilian portuguese. Make sure every text you write is in a proper i18n string and NOT hard coded
